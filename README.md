# About this notebeeok
 
In this notebook, I use the OpenWeatherMap geocoding API to retrieve the geographic coordinates of 4 German cities (Hamburg, DÃ¼sseldorf, Berlin and Munic). My goal is to then retrieve the current weather in these cities from OpenWeatherMap and perform further analysis. I will use Python, the Pandas library and Requests to collect and analyze the data.

The primary goal of this notebook is to demonstrate the process of working with APIs to collect and analyze weather data, as well as to visualize the findings.
